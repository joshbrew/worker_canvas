# Web Worker Canvas Library 🚀


![d-status](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/workercanvas.svg) 
![d-downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/workercanvas.svg)

## Installation 📦

To include this library in your project, simply use:

```bash
npm install workercanvas
# or
yarn add workercanvas
```

## Elevate your applications with seamless off-screen rendering!

This library harnesses the power of Web Workers to take your canvas-based rendering off the main thread 🧵. Experience buttery smooth animations, complex visual computations, and responsive user interfaces—all while keeping your application's main thread free for other critical tasks 🖼️💡.

This is a pure implementation with type support, and adds about 32kb of total weight to your program when using the bundle.

## Usage 🛠️

Import the necessary components from the library and let the magic happen:

```ts
import { Renderer, WorkerCanvas } from 'workercanvas';

const canvas = document.createElement('canvas'); 
canvas.width = 800; canvas.height = 600;
canvas.id = 'myCanvas';
document.body.appendChild('canvas');
const myOffscreenCanvas = new Renderer({
    canvas: canvas,
    context:'2d',
    worker: true, //use our prebundled worker
    //route:"customInitFunction", //set a custom function to pass our Renderer creation logic to, e.g. to create a stage for setting up ThreeJS on the worker
    _id:canvas.id,
    init:(self:WorkerCanvas,canvas,context)=>{ //init called automatically before first draw on thread
        console.log('canvas', canvas)
        canvas.addEventListener('mousedown',(ev)=>{ //ProxyListener mimics most of the necessary mouse and key events e.g. for proxying threejs controls on thread for processing event logic locally on the thread.
            console.log('clicked!', ev, canvas);
        })
    },
    draw:(self:WorkerCanvas,canvas:any,context:CanvasRenderingContext2D)=>{ //render loop starts automatically on thread after receiving canvas and instructions
        context.clearRect(0,0,canvas.width, canvas.height);
        
        context.fillStyle = `rgb(0,${Math.sin(Date.now()*0.001)*255},${Math.cos(Date.now()*0.001)*255})`;
        context.fillRect(0,0,canvas.width,canvas.height);
    }                        
});
```
Start creating fluid animations and graphics right away!


There is a prebundled worker when you use 'true' or you can follow the canvas.worker.ts example to ensure functionality and provide a worker url instead. If you want to invoke threejs etc on the thread you need to define your own worker and have an alternative route to initialize what you need. 


Also includes full type support, for worker and nonworker canvases, though you should really only care about this for multithreading ease of use.
```ts
type WorkerCanvasTransferProps = { //defined in main thread to send to worker
    canvas:HTMLCanvasElement,  
    context?:string, 
    _id?:string,
    draw?:string|((self:any,canvas:any,context:any)=>void),
    update?:string|((self:any,canvas:any,context:any,input:any)=>void),
    init?:string|((self,canvas:any,context:any)=>void),
    clear?:string|((self,canvas:any,context:any)=>void),
    transfer?:any[],
    animating?:boolean, //animation will start automatically, else you can call draw conditionally
    [key:string]:any //any transferrable props you want to use in your animation
}

type CanvasProps = { //defined in worker thread
    canvas:any, //offscreen canvas
    context?:string|CanvasRenderingContext2D|WebGL2RenderingContext|WebGLRenderingContext,
    _id:string,
    width?:number,
    height?:number,
    draw?:string|((self:any,canvas:any,context:any)=>void),
    update?:string|((self:any,canvas:any,context:any,input:any)=>void),
    init?:string|((self,canvas:any,context:any)=>void),
    clear?:string|((self,canvas:any,context:any)=>void),
    animating?:boolean,
    preventDefault?:boolean, //we can generically prevent defaults on key events (except F1-12 for debug reasons)
    [key:string]:any
}

type CanvasControls = {
    _id:string,
    draw:(props?:any,transfer?:any)=>void,
    update:(props:{[key:string]:any},transfer?:any)=>void,
    clear:()=>void,
    init:()=>void,
    stop:()=>void,
    start:()=>void,
    set:(newDrawProps:CanvasProps,transfer?:any)=>void
}

type WorkerCanvasControls = {
    worker:Worker|MessagePort,
    terminate:()=>void
} & CanvasControls

type WorkerCanvas = { //this is the object stored on the worker to track this canvas context
    graph:any, //Graph or Service class
    canvas:any, //OffscreenCanvas
    context?:CanvasRenderingContext2D|WebGL2RenderingContext|WebGLRenderingContext,
    _id:string,
    draw?:((self:WorkerCanvas,canvas:WorkerCanvas['canvas'],context:WorkerCanvas['context'])=>void), //runs in animation loop or on drawFrame calls
    update?:((self:WorkerCanvas,canvas:WorkerCanvas['canvas'],context:WorkerCanvas['context'],input:any)=>void),
    init?:((self:WorkerCanvas,canvas:WorkerCanvas['canvas'],context:WorkerCanvas['context'])=>void),
    clear?:((self:WorkerCanvas,canvas:WorkerCanvas['canvas'],context:WorkerCanvas['context'])=>void),
    animating:boolean, //animation will start automatically, else you can call draw conditionally
    [key:string]:any //any transferrable props you want to use in your animation
}


```

## Sample worker that reroutes for ThreeJS initialization

```ts

import { workerCanvasRoutes, CanvasProps } from './WorkerCanvas';

import * as THREE from 'three'
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js'
import { PickHelper } from './PickHelper'
//etc...
import { EffectComposer } from 'three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js'
import { RenderPass } from 'three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/RenderPass.js'
import { SMAAPass } from 'three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/SMAAPass.js'
import { UnrealBloomPass } from 'three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/UnrealBloomPass.js'
//minimal web worker for running offscreen canvases, 

declare var WorkerGlobalScope;

if(typeof WorkerGlobalScope !== 'undefined') {

    const routes = {
        ...workerCanvasRoutes,
        receiveThreeCanvas:function(options:CanvasProps){ //modified canvas receiver that installs desired threejs modules
                const ThreeProps = { //e.g. install these systems to 'self', which is the worker canvas
                    THREE,
                    OrbitControls,
                    EffectComposer,
                    RenderPass,
                    SMAAPass,
                    UnrealBloomPass,
                    PickHelper
                }

                Object.assign(options, ThreeProps); //install desired props to our canvas's 'self' reference

                console.log(this);
                let renderId = routes.setupCanvas(options); //the the base canvas tools do the rest, all ThreeJS tools are on self, for self contained ThreeJS renders
                //you can use the canvas render loop by default, or don't provide a draw function and just use the init and the Three animate() callback

                //let canvasopts = this.graph.CANVASES[renderId] as WorkerCanvas;

                return renderId;
            }
        //add more compatible routes that don't require graphscript
    };
    
    self.onmessage = (ev) => {
        if(ev.data.route) {
            if(Array.isArray(ev.data.args)) {
                routes[ev.data.route](...ev.data.args);
            } else routes[ev.data.route](ev.data.args);
        } //that's it! The functions handle worker communication internally
    
    }
    
}

export default self as any;

```

Then from main thread we'd call

```ts
import { Renderer, WorkerCanvas } from 'workercanvas';

const canvas = document.createElement('canvas'); 
canvas.width = 800; canvas.height = 600;
canvas.id = 'myCanvas';
document.body.appendChild('canvas');
const myOffscreenCanvas = new Renderer(
    {
        canvas: canvas,
        context:'2d',
        worker: true, //use our prebundled worker
        //route:"customInitFunction", //set a custom function to pass our Renderer creation logic to, e.g. to create a stage for setting up ThreeJS on the worker
        _id:canvas.id,
        context:undefined, //Threejs sets the context
        init:(self:WorkerCanvas,canvas,context)=>{

            //these are installed to the 'self' reference
