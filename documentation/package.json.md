# `workercanvas` Package Configuration

In manifest of node, defined by name 'package',
`workercanvas` stands, 'tis our dear work's package.
The version set at one, full stop, and zero twice,
Describes how we shall start, an Alpha in our splice.

"A toolkit for the threads on canvas that shall render,"
Proclaims the description, with its intent so tender.
The main entry points to `dist`, where index lies,
A common JS structure that none can despise.

The module, it follows, with `esm` as its guide,
And types declaration, side by side, doth bide.
It's marked as a `module`, with `type` that's so clear,
Enlightening the use where imports do appear.

Within the script section, a `start` doth pursue,
Unleashing `tinybuild`, to the project it's true.
And `build`, standing by, the same command will share,
For compiling the source, with diligence and care.

Keywords like "canvas", "worker", thread", and "optimization",
Do hint at the function, and potential fascination.
Penned by Joshua Brewster, with careful hand and thought,
And under LGPL, with freedom it is fraught.

Dependencies are empty, as a newborn babe's gaze,
And `devDepend5ncies` seems misspelled or in a haze.
'Tis likely "devDependencies" was the intended key,
For development extras that in truth set developers free.

Thus stands this JSON, configuration at heart,
For those who in `workercanvas` will play their part.
Now take this documentation, well-versed and well-compiled,
And use it as a map when in the code you're beguiled.
